# TSEGAN
The implement of the paper "Time-domain Speech Enhancement with Generative Adversarial Learning".

## Demo files
Demo files for some enhancement results will be provided in [Enhancement result demo](https://github.com/LittleFlyingSheep/TSEGAN/tree/main/Enhancement%20result%20demo)

## How to train the model
Run `train.py`, noting to modify the path in `train.py`. `train_WGAN()` means train the W-TSEGANs, and `train_Metric_GAN` means to train the M-TSEGANs.

## How to enhance the speech
Run `clean.py`, noting to modify the path in `clean.py`.
